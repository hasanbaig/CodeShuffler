CodeShuffler empowers instructors to rearrange lines within coding files, regardless of the programming language used, producing an output image that presents the shuffled lines of code. Additionally, it generates multiple-choice options, with one of them signifying the correct sequence of coding lines. This tool simplifies the process of conducting paper-based coding assessments, eliminating the need for manual grading and streamlining the evaluation process for educators.

### Instructions
1. You need to install Python Pillow library, which you can do simply by executing the following command:
`pip install pillow`

2. To run the program, you need to execute `main.py` file alongwith the input code filename as a commandline argument. 
For example, to shuffle the code, for example `samplecode.py`, first place it in the directory `\codefiles\` and then execute the following:
`python main.py samplecode.py`

### Settings

1. You can optionally add incorrect instructions at the end of the input code after adding the comment line "**#Incorrect lines below**". See `samplecode.py` for help. Then set the switch `include_incorrect_instructions = True` in `lib\settings.py` file. 

2. You can optionally specify to keep **X** number of lines same in the generated multiple choice questions by setting the value of switch `first_same_X_lines_MCQ` in `lib\settings.py` file. 

3. You can specify how many multiple choice options you want to generate by setting the value of a switch `no_of_choices` in `lib\settings.py` file.
